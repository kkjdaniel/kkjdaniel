### Hey, I'm Karl 👋

Proactive software engineer with a robust technical background, delivering successful web and mobile projects for top UK companies including BAE Systems, Asda, PokerStars, and Sky as well as a variety of startups and SMEs. 

Passionate about the dynamic and ever-evolving JavaScript ecosystem, I find joy in crafting innovative solutions using technologies like React and Node.js. From building engaging user interfaces to server-side logic, I thrive in the versatility and power these tools offer. Beyond the realms of JavaScript, I also embrace the simplicity and efficiency of Go, exploring its capabilities to enhance performance and scalability in my projects.

Outside of coding, I am an avid board gaming enthusiast. Much like the strategic thinking and problem-solving inherent in programming, I appreciate the intricate challenges and social dynamics that board games bring. This dual passion reflects my commitment to creativity, continuous learning, and finding joy in both the digital and analogue realms.
